# SH-Creation (psus-sh-creation)

## Branches :
- SH Production Branch  : **_production_**
- Sh Staging  (You can only have three staging branches):
   - Staging Branch 1: **_sandbox_1_**
   - Staging Branch 2: **_sandbox_2_**
   - Staging Branch 3: **_sandbox_3_**


- Development (You can have as many development branches as you like): 
   - Dev Branch 1: **_dev_1_**
   - Dev Branch 2: **_dev_2_**
   - Dev Branch 3: **_dev_3_**

   
## Code of Conduct
- **IMPORTANT : DO NOT COMMIT anything in the _production_ branch, because _production_ is the _Production Instance_**
- If you want to start development branch fork new branch from _production_ or _staging_ branches and SH will automatically start new development build.
